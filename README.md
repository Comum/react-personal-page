# Welcome to my page repository

## Main

This is a webpage about myself. A small react pdf page that shows a little bit about my skills.

## Commands
 - `npm start` - starts the application
 - `npm run build` - builds the dist folder
 - `npm run lint` - checks linting issues
 - `npm run test` - runs the tests
 - `npm coverage` - this will serve the test coverage in your browser
 - `npm test --coverage` - this will print the coverage report in the terminal

## Aditional info

Even though this page consumes an API - [Thoughts on coding](http://thoughtsoncoding.com/api), I didn't think that having redux to control state would be necessary, it would be like kill an ant with a canon, so I kept with react state.
