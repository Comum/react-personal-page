# Welcome to my page repository

## Main

This is a webpage about myself. A small react pdf page that shows a little bit about my dev skills and my lack of design skills.

Created using [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Commands
 - `npm start` - starts the application
 - `npm run build` - builds the dist folder
 - `npm run test` - runs the tests
 - `npm run eject` - ejects the project from create-react-app
